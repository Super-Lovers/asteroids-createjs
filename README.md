# Asteroids in CreateJS

Asteroids in CreateJS is a small arcade game that I recreated to learn how to use the CreateJS suite of tools such as EaselJS, PreloadJS, AudioJS and TweenJS. Development of the project was a little more than three days and sometimes It felt a bit like programming with PhaserJS. The game loop is simple to program and is a quick way learn, on a beginner level, how to use all CreateJS tools.
